Define the conditions on each stages………… mean the particular stage can be run if condition is met

pipeline{
    agent any
    stages{
        stage('build'){
            when{
                expression{
                    BRANCH_NAME == 'dev' && CODE_CHANGE == true // perform build action only when the branch name is dev and if there is code change"
                }
            }
            steps{
                echo "command  to be executed for build of the project"
            }
        }
        stage('test'){
            when{
                expression{
                    echo "some boolean expression"
                    BRANCH_NAME == 'dev'  // when BRANCH_NAME(environment variable is equal dev , only then test will be performed)
                }
            }
            steps{
                echo "command  to be executed for test of the project"
            }
        }
        stage('deploy'){
            steps{
                echo "command  to be executed for deploy of the project"
            }
        }
    }
