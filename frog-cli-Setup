Install JFrog CLI [brew install jfrog-cli]

Once installed, use the following jfrog-cli commands to configure artifactory repo

- jfrog config add (This will prompt for some info like Jfrog URL, username, password/api key)

- Once config is done, you can test the config using
jfrog rt ping (This should give 'OK')

- You can also see the config using
jfrog config show

- The configuration can then be exported using the 'Server ID' that was provided in Step 2.1
For example, if the "Server ID" was given as tfsjs then
jfrog config export tfsjs (This will export the config as a base-64 which can then be stored as a secret in GitHub)
